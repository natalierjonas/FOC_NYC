#**dauto updating FOC tracking website, arrivals to Port of New York**

## **The problem**

Ships flying "flags of convenience" (FOCs) dock daily in NYC, flown by illicit operators and legal industries alike. Such vessels use flags registered to their non-native countries to skirt environment, labor and safety regulation, capitalizing on the inherent ambiguity of international waters. Despite blatant human rights violations and ecosystem harm, they are integral to our supply chain. 

## **Methodology**

Used data from MyShipTracking, one of the few open-source compilers of ship info. Unfortunately, the free version only allowed for "estimated arrivals" (with future ones included), as well as real-time docking.

Filtered for these countries: Panama Marshall Islands, The Bahamas Liberia, Malta, Antigua and Barbuda, Cyprus. However, there are upwards of 48 common FoC violators.

## **New skills**

Applying web scraping to real-time, constantly-updated data. Coding in HTML to change the site's appearance and front-end info shown to site visitors. Definitely got much better at scraping and working in HTML!

## **Add later**

Would love to add a detail where each ship has a snippet explaining what they are carrying or potentially what violations have been tacked on to the ship operator or ship itself.
