        <h3>Major cities of the world, ranked by their air quality</h3>
        <p>Dozens of nations allow their flags to be registered and flown by ships originating from other countries, allowing them to skirt more stringent labor, taxation and environmental requirements in their countries of origin. These vessels dock in New York daily.

FoCs allow illegal maritime activities (such as drug smuggling and human trafficking) to proliferate, in particular in relation to extractive industries such as fishing. Flying flags from countries that oftentimes are landlocked, without a fishing industry, allows vessels with FoCs to commit crimes in international waters without a traceable identity. As a result, such crimes go unpunished and uninterrupted.

Flags of convenience are bought via open registry, often from poorer nations. The seven countries most utilized/popular for FoCs are filtered for here: Panama, Marshall Islands, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Liberia, Malta and Cyprus, although there are upwards of 48 nations popular for their FoCs.
